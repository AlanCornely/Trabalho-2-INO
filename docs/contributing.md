### Found a bug?

Do not open an issue on GitHub if the bug is a security vulnerability in Rails, and instead send an email reporting the bug. Be sure to include a clear title and description,
as much relevant information as possible, and the code sample or an executable test case demonstrates expected behavior that is not occurring.

If the problem is already being worked on or resolved, we will send you feedback.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Make sure the description clearly describes the problem and solution.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted. But if you think it's really relevant, send an email and we'll evaluate it more meticulously.

### Are you looking to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change via Email and start writing code presenting a means for the desired feature.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback on the change. GitHub issues are primarily for bug reporting and fixes.

* Do you have questions about the source code?

Ask any questions about how to use via email.

Thanks!
