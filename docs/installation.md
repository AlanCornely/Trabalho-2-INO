# installation

## requirements:
### hardware:
**Arduino Board:** A microcontroller compatible with Arduino (**recommended:** UnoArduSimV2.9.2).

**USB cable:** To connect the Arduino to the computer.

## Input Components:

**Buttons or Switches:** Connected to digital pins 0 to 7 and 13 to provide binary inputs.

## Output Components:

**LEDs or other signaling devices:** Connected to digital pins 8 to 12 to show the result of the sum.

## Software:

**Arduino IDE:** The integrated development platform for Arduino, which you can download from the official Arduino IDE website.
Steps to Run the Code

**Install the Arduino IDE:** If you don't already have the Arduino IDE, download and install it on your computer.
Connect Arduino to Computer: Using the USB cable, connect Arduino to your computer.

## Configure the Hardware:

Connect the buttons or switches to digital pins 0 to 7 and 13. Each button must be connected between the digital pin and GND (ground).
Connect LEDs or other signaling devices to digital pins 8 to 12, with suitable resistors to limit the current.

## Upload the Code:
Click the Upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to the Arduino board.
Wait until the upload process is complete.
