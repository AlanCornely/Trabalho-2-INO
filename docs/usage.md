# Code Description

The code performs the sum of two 4-bit numbers (nibbles) using simple binary arithmetic and displays the result and the carry bit on LEDs.

## Steps for Use:

### operation:

* Adjust the pin 0 to 3 knobs to set the first nibble (nib1).

* Adjust pin knobs 4 to 7 to set the second nibble (nib2).

* Press the button connected to pin 13 to start summing.

* The LEDs on pins 8 to 12 will indicate the sum result and the carry bit.

### Usage Examples

**Sum 3 + 5:**

* Set the first nibble (nib1) to 0011 (3 in binary).

* Set the second nibble (nib2) to 0101 (5 in binary).

* Press the sum button (pin 13).

* The LEDs on pins 8 to 11 will show the result 1000 (8 in binary) and pin 12 will show the carry bit (0).
